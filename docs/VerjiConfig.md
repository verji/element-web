## How to use feature flags
First we have to define them in the element framework
-   UIFeatures.ts : SearchWarning = "UIFeature.SearchWarning"
-   Settings.ts
```
        [UIFeature.SearchWarning]: {
            supportedLevels: LEVELS_UI_FEATURE,
            default: true,
        },
```
Second we have to define in our local config.json under section 'SettingsDefaults'
-   config.json : "UIFeature.SearchWarning": false,

And to use it we apply this check to the component we wish to control, like this
```
     if (!SettingsStore.getValue(UIFeature.SearchWarning ) return <></>;
     or
    {SettingsStore.getValue(UIFeature.HomePageButtons) && showButtons}
```

# Custom Verji Modules

Verji uses the matrix/element module system to dynamically build customised features. Some hooks for these customisations needs to be maintained in matrix-react-sdk. We mainly have two types of modules.

* GUI-modules (Custom components)
    - Uses a lifecycle to swap an existing component, with our custom component(s)
* Extenstion-modules
    - Uses hooks to inject custom logic and features

## Verji GUI-Modules
